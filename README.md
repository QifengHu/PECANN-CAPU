# PECANN-CAPU

**Conditionally Adaptive Augmented Lagrangian Method (CA-ALM) for Physics-Informed Learning of Forward and Inverse Problems**

We present several key advances to the PECANN framework, substantially improving its capacity and efficiency for solving challenging partial differential equations (PDEs):

1. **Generalized ALM** — extends the Augmented Lagrangian Method to support multiple, independent penalty parameters for enforcing heterogeneous constraints.
2. **Constraint aggregation** — addresses inefficiencies associated with point-wise enforcement of PDE constraints.
3. **Fourier feature mapping** — a single Fourier feature layer captures highly oscillatory, multi-scale solutions where alternative physics-informed methods often require multiple mappings or costlier architectures.
4. **Time-windowing** — enables seamless long-time evolution of transport equations without relying on discrete time models.
5. **Conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU)** — accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for constraints with larger violations while coordinating updates across multiple penalty parameters.

We demonstrate PECANN–CAPU on diverse benchmarks:

- Transonic rarefaction problem
- Reversible scalar advection by a vortex
- Helmholtz and Poisson's equations with high-wavenumber solutions
- Inverse heat source identification

The framework achieves competitive accuracy across all cases compared with established methods and recent approaches based on Kolmogorov–Arnold networks. An important implication of our investigation is that pure regression is insufficient to evaluate network architecture in physics-informed learning. Collectively, these advances improve the robustness, computational efficiency, and applicability of PECANN to demanding problems in scientific computing.

## Key Features

- **Conditionally Adaptive Augmented Lagrangian Method (CA-ALM)** — automatically balances PDE losses and boundary/initial condition constraints via adaptive Lagrange multipliers (Λ) and penalty parameters (μ)
- **Optimizer agnostic** — supports both Adam and L-BFGS, with optional learning rate scheduling for Adam
- **Modular design** — the core `PECANNTrainer` and `PECANNState` classes are problem-independent; users only need to supply an evaluation function that returns the objective and constraint residuals
- **Lightweight** — minimal dependencies (PyTorch only)

```

### Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.8
- PyTorch ≥ 1.10

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from pecann_capu import PECANNTrainer, PECANNState

# 1. Define your model
model = YourNetwork().to(device)

# 2. Define an evaluation function
#    eval_fn(model, training=True) -> (objective, constr)
#      objective: scalar tensor (e.g. PDE residual loss)
#      constr:    1-D tensor of constraint violations (e.g. BC/IC residuals)
def eval_fn(model, training=True):
    objective = compute_pde_residual(model)
    constr = torch.stack([bc_loss_1, bc_loss_2, ...])
    return objective, constr

# 3. Initialize ALM state
num_constraints = 2  # number of BC/IC constraints
state = PECANNState(
    Lambda=torch.zeros(num_constraints, device=device),
    Mu=torch.ones(num_constraints, device=device),
    Bar_v=torch.zeros(num_constraints, device=device),
    previous_loss=torch.tensor(float('inf'), device=device),
)

# 4. Create the trainer
eta = torch.ones(num_constraints, device=device)  # base penalty scale
trainer = PECANNTrainer(eval_fn=eval_fn, eta=eta)

# 5. Set up optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# 6. Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Primal step
    objective, constr, loss = trainer.step(
        model, optimizer, state, using_lbfgs=False
    )
    # Dual update
    trainer.update_alm(state, constr, loss)
```

## API Reference

### `PECANNState`

Dataclass holding the ALM state that persists across epochs.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Lambda` | `Tensor` | Lagrange multipliers (one per constraint) |
| `Mu` | `Tensor` | Penalty parameters (one per constraint) |
| `Bar_v` | `Tensor` | Exponential moving average of squared constraints |
| `previous_loss` | `Tensor` | Loss from the previous epoch (for dual update condition) |

### `PECANNTrainer`

Main trainer class. Constructed with:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `eval_fn` | — | `eval_fn(model, training) -> (objective, constr)` |
| `eta` | — | Base penalty scale tensor |
| `omega` | 0.999 | Loss improvement threshold for dual update |
| `zeta` | 0.99 | EMA decay rate for constraint variance tracking |
| `eps` | 1e-16 | Small constant for numerical stability |

**Methods:**

- `step(model, optim, state, using_lbfgs, scheduler=None)` — performs one primal optimization step; returns `(objective, constr, loss)`
- `update_alm(state, constr, loss)` — performs the dual variable update

### `PrimalOptimizer`

Static utility class for executing a single optimization step with either Adam or L-BFGS.

## Example Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `psn_b50_fourier_dom128/` | 1D Poisson equation with multi-scale solution (b=50), Fourier features, 128 domain points |
